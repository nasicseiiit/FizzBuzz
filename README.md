=======
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14,
Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26,
Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, â€¦

Once the user enters the input it code start encoding with the lower bound upto upperbound and will return result 
according to the above problem
